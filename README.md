# Motivation
I wanted to venture from Vanilla JS and began to learn React. This is my first attempt at building a project using React.

# Tech/Framework Used
React
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Google Maps API
Paypal Express Checkout API

# Installation
A) npm run build <br>
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

B) Can be hosted locally if folder is downloaded.
  B.1 Download folder as .zip folder.
  B.2 Extract files to destination of your choice.
  B.3 Use command terminal and use npm start to deploy to localhost:3000.
